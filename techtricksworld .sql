('5 Tips For Designing Your First Mobile App', '\r\n\r\nKnow What The Client Wants\r\nIf you?re designing a mobile app for a client, the first thing you want to do is get the client to spell out their expectations exactly and in writing. You don?t want to leave any room for error. Be sure to ask pertinent questions like ?what do you want your app to do?? and ?what is your target audience?? and ?what is our timeline for completing the project??.\r\n\r\nStaying in contact with the client throughout the design process is a must. Clients will often change their minds on certain aspects of the project once they see it in a mockup or wireframe, making edits costly if you?re farther along in the process.\r\n\r\nKeeping in contact with clients is simple with cloud sharing and storage services, conference calling services, and other applications. Be sure to inform your client of your preferred communication methods, and keep them updated with changes to the project as they come.\r\n\r\nFocus On Responsive Design\r\nUnless the client is (or you are) targeting a specific user base, such as only iOS users or only Android, your design should be focused on responsiveness. Each platform has different standards for your mobile app to function properly.\r\n\r\nIf you?re designing an app for Android, and you want to make it iOS compatible, there are different standards and rules for Apple?s operating system that you?ll need to take into consideration so that Apple users won?t become frustrated with your app.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that the more diverse your user base is, the more useful your app will be. Designing for everyone is a good way to increase your app?s reach and therefore increase downloads and shares.\r\n\r\nResponsive design can also increase web traffic, as it will allow your brand to be accessed either through the app or through your website, despite the platform it?s being accessed from. With a responsive design, the site will load correctly on any platform, eliminating frustration from slow-loading pages.\r\n\r\nKeep UX In Mind\r\nUser experience is an extremely important part of the design process. It is a process by which you determine what your users will experience when they interact with your product, or in this case, your mobile app.\r\n\r\nGenerally, a good UX starts with a few simple questions from the designer: Is this app useful? Does it serve a function? Is it simple to navigate/perform well? Think of what you like your mobile apps to do and how you expect them to perform.\r\n\r\nIf your banking app doesn?t load correctly, you?re probably going to become frustrated with it. That?s a part of UX. If the app doesn?t load correctly or navigate well, users will generally become frustrated with the way it performs, and likely uninstall it.\r\n\r\nThat?s why we address these issues before the app is published to a store. Focusing on UX during your design process will ensure you?re looking at it from the users? point of view and designing the app to fit their needs and expectations. Remember that a product is there to solve a problem for its customers, and if it doesn?t do that, it?s not a useful product.\r\n\r\nUse a Wireframe\r\nIf you want to keep a customer updated while simultaneously designing with UX in mind, then you need to use wireframe software like Axure in your design process. These excellent tools make the design process simple and streamlined by providing a roadmap for the project.\r\n\r\nHaving a blueprint for your project is the best way to design a responsive app while keeping the client happy. You?ll be able to show the client every step of the process, gaining valuable feedback throughout. This feedback will help you make edits as you go, preventing the costly and time consuming post-release updates and edit.\r\n\r\nWireframe tools often include cloud storage and sharing and even minor team sharing tools, so truthfully a wireframe is much more than just a design tool. Think of it as the central design hub from which you can make changes, share with clients and team members, and iron out important details.\r\n\r\nStay Organized\r\nProper organization is an important attribute of any successful project. Disorganization creates confusion and frustration in both the team and the client. Staying organized can mean the difference between delivering a quality app on time and delivering a sub-par app outside of the deadline.\r\n\r\nStaying organized starts with organizing files and projects. A wireframe tool is a great way to stay organized, with cloud storage and easily accessible tools for the whole team. You can also utilize your own cloud storage, such as Google Drive or Dropbox.\r\n\r\nIn addition to tracking files and projects, keeping track of your team is part of staying organized. Be sure to stay in constant contact and hold each team member accountable for their part in the project. Make sure you?ve made everyone aware of the client?s standards as well as the company standards, so everyone knows what is expected of them.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nAs long as you stay organized and use the right tools, designing a mobile app can be a fun project, and the reward of seeing those downloads each week is enough inspiration to being developing your next app. Keep your team and clients updated, stay organized, and use the right tools, and you?ll have a successful mobile app in no time at all.', 1, '2019-10-02 08:00:45', 1, 'img/Tips-For-Designing-Your-First-Mobile-App-.png', 2, 3),

Best Scary VR Game for iPhone\r\nVR haunted House is one of the best VR horror games on Android that can take the breath off from even a die-hard horror gamer. The ambiance of the game is so dark and messy that you would be scared to death.\r\n\r\nGamers and experts believe it to be a game that stands between zombie shooters and a haunted house game. The stereoscopic 3D performance makes it an exceptional choice for the sheer degree of performance that it offers you. And yes, the non-directional sound will help create an exceptional fear psychosis. You will come across roaring zombies quite frequently.\r\n\r\nThe animation and ambiance of the game are quite astounding. 3D lighting gives you a realistic experience.\r\n\r\n11:57\r\n11:57 is perhaps the first of its kind horror game that spells doom with the 360 degree nightmarish experience. You will, in fact, be the main character of the game. Instead of watching the game unfold in front of you, you will find that entire action revolves around you.\r\n\r\nRather being a game, it may be considered to be a short movie. If you have watched those horror theme parks, you will find the game ambiance somewhat equivalent to it. You are transported to a scary location where you are alone with the big bloody world of sinister characters around you.\r\n\r\nThere isn?t any sort of music; all you hear is someone stepping in or the sound of a door opening. You are so scared that you are sure of something coming up from somewhere all of a sudden. The movie or the game is capable enough t make your legs shake and palm sweat ? so says one of the reviewers.\r\n\r\nInsidious VR\r\nInsidious VR is an intense game for those who love scary VR games and movies.

If you have already watched the movie, get ready to experience all that creepiness in full 3D.\r\n\r\nYou will find the 3D experience completely scary. Of the experience is shorter, but definitely the scariest one you can ever think of. The final moments of the game tend to be highly scary and perhaps not meant for those with a faint heart.\r\n\r\nThe execution of the characters, plot and the overall experience is indeed is well done. While the movie was the scariest ever for most of us, the VR game based on the movie takes it well ahead. The graphics have been done so realistic that you will come to believe that what you se before you is entirely realistic.\r\n\r\nZombie Shooter VR\r\nZombie Shooter VR is a game set in the apocalyptic era. The world has become full of the blood thirsty zombies, and they are all after you. You need to choose your weapons and take on the zombies and save the world from the apocalypse.\r\n\r\nZombie Shooter is all about how to attack the zombies and win your duels against them. Should we share a trick? Well, you need to attack them on their face. Your success rate depends upon the skills you learn in attacking and eliminating the zombies in the right way.\r\n\r\nRemember, unlike other games where you use the auto shooting modes, this is all about getting it done on your own. You need to be on your feet to eliminate the zombies by fighting them in reality. That would make the game more scary and exciting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', 1, '2019-10-02 08:06:22', 1, 'img/Horror-VR-Games-500x320.jpg', 28, 1),
('Writer?s Block? Here?s How Your Business Can Generate Blog Posts for a Year', '\r\n\r\n \r\nAs a business owner, chances are you understand the important role that SEO plays in your success. Search engine optimization allows your content to rank higher and be more easily discovered by people looking for services, products, and content like yours. Maintaining consistency is one of the best blogging practices?and shouldn?t go left ignored. Consistent blogging helps retain loyal readers, makes it easier to become an authority figure in your field, and helps appeals to Google?who likes fresh content and long-tail keywords.\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, coming up with valuable content on a consistent basis is certainly easier said than done. If you?re a business owner spearheading your own content strategy, you?ll likely find yourself with writer?s block. But fret not: there certain things you can do to help alleviate the dreaded writer?s block and continue pushing blog posts as a beginner.\r\n\r\nHere are a few tips:\r\n\r\nTake a ?Peek Inside? Amazon Books\r\nA neat feature on Amazon is the ability to flip through the first few pages or chapters of books before making a purchase. Typically, these first few pages include the index. These hundreds of open indexes give you the opportunity to score from fresh blog ideas by remixing simple chapter titles into content for your website. For example, let?s say you run a small plant and gardening shop. Go on and conduct a search for gardening content in the Books section.\r\n\r\nOnce you start discovering different books, you?ll find there are plenty of ways these chapter titles can be used for blog posts. Sifting through the first few pages of a book can yield plenty of opportunity. The same technique can also be used in bookstores, too. When your schedule permits, head over to a bookstore and take the time to sort through the books in your industry and niche, garnering ideas based on the content across various resources. Within just a few hours, you could easily have a list of blog ideas for the entire year.\r\n\r\nUse Online Topic Generators\r\nYou?d be surprised to discover that there are plenty of online topic generators that you can take advantage of. These digital tools are there to help you find clarity with some of your ideas. While these tools aren?t always exactly foolproof, they do help to get your ideas flowing, and can steer you in the right direction when you?re stuck.\r\n\r\nHere are tools to get you started:\r\n\r\nHubspot?s Blog Topic Generator\r\nKeyword Tool.io\r\nPortent Content Idea Generator\r\nBuzzSumo\r\nRe-Work Existing Content\r\nIn some cases, the inspiration for new blog posts is sitting right in your backyard. Take a look at the content you have (or check out similar blogs for inspiration) and start to think about different ways you can approach that angle to turn it into a different article. Manipulating the title to address different audiences and areas is one way to do this. For example, as a gardening company, you might have an article called ?7 Ways to Incorporate Plants in Your Bathroom.? You can then go on to create a similar article for dressing different areas in the home with plants.\r\n\r\nAlso Read: Why and How Should You Repurpose Your Old Blog Posts?\r\n\r\nPutting a negative spin on current content is also a good way to come up with new ideas. Articles that detail what readers SHOULDN?T do are fairly popular. In this case, your article might look something like, ?7 Things You Should NEVER Do With Bathroom Plants? would be a good start. Offering advice and tips are great, but you?ll double your content with an anti-advice spin.\r\n\r\nHire a Freelancer or Agency\r\nYes, this seems like an obvious tip. Yet, there are many reasons why business owners don?t consider outsourcing their writing efforts. For starters, you might be concerned about relinquishing control. Or perhaps you?re worried that the writer or agency won?t capture your brand voice.\r\n\r\nAlso Read: 7 Highest Paying Freelance Jobs in India\r\n\r\nHowever, many businesses?from startups to large corporations?manage to successfully transition their writing efforts. These third-party sources work for you, and no control is lost. If you?re struggling for ideas, have a candid discussion about what sort of topics you?re looking for, and allow them to come out with blog ideas for the new 1-3 months, pending your approval. And of course, take the time to create a Style Guide. A style guide dictates how content should sound, and makes it easier for the hired individual to capture the voice and essence you?re looking for.', 2, '2019-10-02 08:21:26', 2, 'img/Writers-block.jpg', 29, 2),
('6 Ways to Kill a Blog in the First 60 Days', '\r\nIt takes years to build a good blog. But it only takes 60 days to ruin something that could have been a good blog.\r\n\r\nIt?s hard to track exactly how long the average blog will last because most unsuccessful blogs aren?t taken down. They?re left live (but not active) out in web space purgatory.\r\n\r\nHowever, when a blog fails, odds are good that the damage was done within the first 60 days of the first post. Or the damage was done while the blog was still on the whiteboard.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, here are 6 ways you can ruin a perfectly good blog in the first 60 days.\r\n\r\n6 Ways to Kill a Blog in the First 60 Days\r\nBad Cheap Hosting\r\nThe second you sign up for a year of hosting that costs less than the coffee you will drink to write your first blog, you?re not in the right headspace.\r\n\r\nCheap hosting will cost you far more than you think. Certainly, don?t overspend on your WordPress hosting or sign up for an enterprise level plan. But take this step very seriously.\r\n\r\nHere?s what cheap hosting will cost you:\r\n\r\nSpeed, especially during peak times\r\nReliability, with very loosely reported downtime and outages\r\nCustomer service, when you do experience an outage\r\nScalability, when it?s time to upgrade\r\nThese free or cheap hosting sites are also known to cap your bandwidth and speed. So if you start writing really amazing content and earning traffic, they will slow you down and kill all of your momentum.\r\n\r\nNot Having a Niche\r\nThe podcast and blogging worlds are full of people who simply want to have their own blog or podcast. These people fail and grow disinterested pretty quickly, because they think they?re interesting enough to ramble away, with no niche or point.\r\n\r\nThere is far too much competition today to get away with unfocused content like that, unless you?re already an established celebrity or public figure.\r\n\r\nTap into your passions to find your niche, and know that an audience will always exist for that niche. You need to zero in on that niche, instead of shotgun blasting your content to anyone.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot Having a Plan\r\nSome people are impulsive and will pick their WordPress theme and start writing the same day. However, a lack of a plan often leads to the blog falling flat. Subsequently, the author loses interest pretty quickly, after an initial surge of enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nThey may say, ?It was more work than I expected.? That?s only partially true. Most of the work is just not where they expected. It?s in the planning stage, which they skipped completely.\r\n\r\nYou need to plan:\r\n\r\nWhat you?re going to write about (a nice, long list of topics)\r\nWho your audience will be (that niche we mentioned above)\r\nHow often you?re going to write\r\nHow you?re going to promote it (more on that later)\r\nHow you?re going to measure success (again, more on that later)\r\nThis work could take anywhere from hours to weeks. However, it?s work that must be done.\r\n\r\nNo Plan to Promote\r\nYou know you?re going to share this blog within your social circle, but doing that can really set a hard ceiling on your growth and success.\r\n\r\nTo truly grow, you?re going to have to pay to promote this blog outside of your network. The good news is this is actually shockingly affordable. And you can really lock in on your niche by targeting geographic areas or jobs when you promote on LinkedIn, Facebook, or Instagram.\r\n\r\nNot Knowing What Success Looks Like\r\nA lot of people will quit blogging because they didn?t really know what success would look like.\r\n\r\nYou need to know if your key indicator of success is:\r\n\r\nTraffic\r\nLeads\r\nSales\r\nSignups or appointments\r\nSocial activity, such as Likes, Shares or Retweets\r\nYou need to lock into 1 or 2 of those metrics and not worry about anything else, especially in the early years. Trying to chase an undefined combination of all of them will just lead to disappointment, frustration, and ultimately, defeat.\r\n\r\nTitling Your First Blog ?Why I Started This Blog?\r\nTo be clear, you can make your first blog topic about why you started this blog, if it?s an interesting reason or compelling story. However, that?s not how to announce your presence to the world.\r\n\r\nFor example, let?s say you?re a mommy blogger who is targeting other mom?s who have kids with autism. That presents a huge potential to write great content and find a huge niche audience. So you want to attack it the right way!\r\n\r\nYou want to tell your story, and why you started this blog because you know the story will resonate. So don?t title it ?Why I started This Blog,? you can do better.\r\n\r\nUse something emotional from the actual story like, ?My Son?s Principal Called Him Slow and That?s Not Ok.? See how you can tell the exact same story, with a more emotive headline to lock into your readers? interest?\r\n\r\nDid you notice a common theme in that list? Most of these faults can be attributed to a lack of planning, or simply not taking blogging seriously. Failing to have all of these things in place is setting yourself up to fail.\r\n\r\nSome of these mistakes take place in your head before you write a single word. Some of them take place during the setup or writing process. But any combination of them can lead to early frustration and giving up in less than 2 months.', 2, '2019-10-02 08:23:11', 2, 'img/6ways.png', 30, 1),

('Intro to SEO for your E-commerce website', '\r\nWhile every website, regardless of its function or niche, should always adhere to standard SEO best practices across the board, taking your SEO to the next level is a little different for e-commerce sites. This is because your visitors? intent is different ? they?re (hopefully!) looking to buy a product, rather than just searching for general information on a topic.\r\n\r\nThey?ve probably already got something in mind, but want to explore their options, compare different products and prices, and ideally receive some tailored suggestions from you. We take a look at the basics of SEO specifically for e-commerce websites and online stores.\r\n\r\nChoose your platform wisely\r\nUnlike a standard company website with just a few pages dedicated to different services, e-commerce sites can end up with thousands of pages dedicated to different product lines, variations, groupings, colors, styles, and themes.\r\n\r\nAs with any website, the more pages, and unique URLs you have, the harder it gets to keep everything optimized the way it should be. If you get off to a bad start and are making even minor errors from the beginning, they can become a nightmare to fix (or even find) months down the line.\r\n\r\nUnless you?re extremely confident in your web development abilities, building your site on a dedicated e-commerce platform makes a lot more sense. Many offer free trials so you can get a feel for whether you like the interface or not. In addition, several platforms ?like Shopify and WooComerce for example? already have a host of built-in SEO features to make your life easier. These usually include things like ?automagic? 301 redirects and canonical tags for duplicate content, social sharing buttons and automatic generation of your website?s sitemap.xml and robots.txt files.\r\n\r\nIf you do decide to go it on your own, however, then make absolutely sure you?re using HTTPS across your entire website, so your customers? personal details are encrypted. If you?re using a platform like WordPress, make sure to get familiar with the Yoast SEO plugin, which will offer tips along the way, and help you get your content SEO-ready before you publish.\r\n\r\nGet to grips with keyword research\r\nWith standard websites, keyword research usually involves looking for topics that get high search volumes but don?t have so much competition that there?s little chance of ranking for them. For e-commerce websites, you?re trying to be a bit more specific ? attracting highly targeted traffic that?s ready to convert. That said, you?re still following the same basic formula.\r\n\r\nAnother great way to get keyword and topic ideas is to get inspiration from your competitors! Giants like Amazon and any top-ranking e-commerce sites in your niche are the perfect place to begin. See what keywords they?re ranking for (a clue you should aim for different, more specific long-tail keywords), what their site architecture is like, and any obvious weak spots, like categories which have thin content you know you could easily flesh out.\r\n\r\nSearching your major keywords on Google and checking the ?People also ask? and ?Searches related to? boxes can also be a quick and simple option to get some general ideas. Once you have your basic keywords and phrases, you can then use whichever keyword research tool you prefer to expand on your ideas, compare search volumes, find LSI keywords, and start building up a list of potential topics to create content, pages and blog posts around.\r\n\r\nKeyword research is going to be a critical factor in your success, so if you?re not confident in your ability to do it thoroughly enough, then rather partner with an established SEO company like Ruby Digital who can. Remember also that you?ll need to revisit your keyword strategy from time to time. Changing consumer demand, new competitors arriving on the scene, and new products entering the market can all have an effect on which keywords will perform best. If you can spot a trend before the competition and get your content out there first, you can attract a valuable source of new, ready-to-buy traffic.\r\n\r\nGet the technical basics right\r\nIf you already have an existing e-commerce site, then identifying site errors with a free tool like Screaming Frog is a must. Tools like this crawl your website, links, and images for SEO errors like duplicate pages, meta titles and descriptions, missing header tags, redirects, and much more. You?ll want to sort these out before you start adding any new content and check back from time to time to ensure you?re not falling back into bad habits.\r\n\r\nIf you?re using an e-commerce platform with built-in SEO tools already, then remember you should still be including any relevant keywords in the following:\r\n\r\nImage file names\r\nImage alt text\r\nThe URLs of all product pages, blog posts, and category/topic pages\r\nUse internal linking to create a customer journey\r\nWhen someone visits an e-commerce site, they?re probably looking to compare similar products. Whenever you add a new product, consider what someone with a higher or lower budget might be interested in, and make sure you entice them to check out these options using internal links and thumbnail images.\r\n\r\nMake your content entertaining, informative and easy to read\r\nKeeping sentences and paragraphs short, breaking up long stretches of text with images or videos, and organizing product data in a logical, easy-to-follow manner can all help keep visitors on your site for longer.\r\n\r\nThis not just good for your rankings but gives you more time to convince them to hit that ?Add to cart? button!\r\n\r\nOptimize your page load speeds\r\nWe live in the kind of world where people start to get antsy if a website takes longer than three seconds to load. Conversely, making sure your site loads that much faster than a big competitor?s can be a pretty effective way to encourage visitors to purchase from you instead.\r\n\r\nYou can use a free tool like Pingdom or Google?s PageSpeed Insights tool to see where you stand and then act accordingly to improve it by optimizing images, leveraging browser caching, ?minifying? CSS and removing redirects.\r\n\r\nWhile doing it right takes time, an e-commerce site which focuses on the right keywords, loads quickly across different devices, and always adheres to best SEO practices can be massively rewarding!', 2, '2019-10-02 08:38:47', 4, 'img/ecom-1.png', 33, 1);

('5 Questions to Ask Yourself Before Choosing Point of Sale Software', '\r\nPOS software is more advanced than ever, with many POS systems providing extras such as employee tracking, analytics tools, and real-time sales number and activity overviews. With such amazing features, it?s easy to see why many businesses are upgrading their outdated POS systems for these modern alternatives. Here are some questions you should ask yourself before choosing new point of sale software for your business.\r\n\r\nDoes The Software Come With Dedicated Customer Support?\r\nThis is crucial to choosing the right POS software for your business. Without a good customer support system, your new software may wind up being a hindrance rather than an advantage. Any software should have a dedicated support staff behind it because you can be sure that any technology will malfunction at some point.\r\n\r\nA dedicated support staff will assist you in navigating any complex issues that arise with your POS system, as well as help to answer questions about the limitations and extra features of the software itself.\r\n\r\nHaving answers to difficult questions will ensure that your POS system functions properly at all times, helping you avoid frustrated customers and employees. There?s nothing worse than a malfunction during checkout that you don?t have the answer to. Problems such as this can cause your customers to lose faith in the competence of your staff, as well as patience with the checkout process itself.\r\n\r\nWhere Do I Complete Most of My Business Transactions?\r\nThe answer to this question will help you choose a POS system that is more suited to the needs of your business. If you?re doing a large portion of business online, you may want to choose a POS system like Shopify, which is specifically designed for e-commerce applications. If you?re a brick and mortar store, Square or Vend may be the better choice.\r\n\r\nWhile Square and Vend also offer e-commerce solutions, it?s best to choose software that is tailored to the exact nature of your business for maximum compatibility. With so many point of sale software options available, choosing the best one for your business can mean the difference between a smooth transition and a difficult one.\r\n\r\nAre My Customers Frustrated With The Checkout Process?\r\nPerhaps the best indicator that it?s time for a new POS system is the frustration of your customers. If you?re noticing customers becoming agitated with a slow or otherwise inefficient checkout process, or receiving written feedback in the form of reviews or complaints, it?s probably a good time to make the switch.\r\n\r\nPay close attention to customer feedback and identify what exactly about the process is frustrating for them. Is it the speed of the checkout process? Or perhaps the overall process itself is simply inefficient? These questions can best be answered by those that use the system the most.\r\n\r\nToo much frustration with your checkout process will likely cause even loyal customers to seek out another brand. Never underestimate the power of an efficient checkout process. Moving customers through the line quickly can leaving them feeling stress-free and more likely to purchase from your business in the future.\r\n\r\nWhat Security Features Does The Software Offer?\r\nAny time you?re dealing with money, security should be your number one concern; especially if you?re dealing with someone else?s money. Your customers will want to be sure that they?re swiping credit and debit cards in a secure system, as breaches can cause monetary damages and leave you accountable for the intrusion.\r\n\r\nLook into your next POS system?s security features before making a choice for your business. Be sure that both hardware and software are secure when running debit or credit cards, and that the company behind your POS software provides support staff and security breach protocols.\r\n\r\nWhat Does It Cost?\r\nAt last, we come to the one question that every business will ask: what does it cost? This is an important factor in choosing your next POS system, as there are many freeware POS systems available. Just remember that the general rule ?you get what you pay for? applies here as well.\r\n\r\nChoosing a POS system by price depends on a number of factors. What does it cost monthly (or annually)? Can my business afford the cost of the POS system and its hardware? Do I need to purchase my own tablet or other hardware?\r\n\r\nIdentifying all cost factors of your new POS system will help you decide on a package that best suits the needs of your business. Many modern POS software providers offer basic packages for small businesses or e-commerce sites, a premium or middle package for larger franchises, and an enterprise option for large chains.\r\n\r\nThe industry your business operates in can also have an effect on the cost of your POS system. For instance, a grocery POS system generally costs more than a bar POS system. Choosing between high and low-end software also affects price, with high-end POS software costing about 1.5-2 times as much as its low-end counterparts.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nChoosing a POS solution for your business is easier than ever with the limitless information available on the web. There are hundreds of POS options to choose from, so with a little research, you?re sure to find the one that works for you. Always check the security features, support options, and cost of the software beforehand. Informed decisions always cost less in the end.\r\n', 1, '2019-10-02 09:01:23', 7, 'img/pos.jpg', 37, 23);
